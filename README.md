This is only for "trigger bot" on Halo 4. (Actually shit, but WORKS)

This is an actually shit way to do this for Halo 4, but it works.
I created this for the game mode SWAT on Halo 4.

It is currently binded to button 4 on the side of your mouse (VK_XBUTTON1)
It checks for the red crosshair and then shoots. Nothing more, nothing less.
