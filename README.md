<h1>Halo 4 Color Bot</h1>

This is only for "trigger bot" on Halo 4. (Kind of shit code but hey, it works.)

This was made for the game mode "SWAT" and sometimes works OK-ish in Snipers.

It is currently binded to mouse button 4 on the side of your mouse (VK_XBUTTON1)

It checks for the red crosshair and then shoots. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you're wondering how to get this to work. Create a Console Application in C++, paste the code and build the project in x64.<br>
Make sure to download the Mouse DLL from: https://github.com/ddxoft/master<br>
Extract <code>dd32695.x64.dll</code> from the ZIP: <code>dd.official.EV.7z\dd.32695</code><br>
Place it in the folder with your .EXE and rename the .DLL to <code>3jkbnhhjkb.dll</code><br>
Run the .EXE as an Administrator
